perl HBase::REST

HBase::REST is a perl client library for the HBase Stargate REST service.

For now, it is very much an early work in progress and it barely implements
list, get, and put functionality.

usage:

use HBase::REST;

my $h = HBase::REST->new
    or die "error: cannot connect to HBase @ $server";

my @rows = $h->get('rest-test', 'row1');
print Dumper(@rows);

Please let me know if you are interested this module!
